Stop dungeon guardians and dayprimes before they harm anyone.

This plugin requires no configuration and handles:
+ Killing Dungeon Guardians, spawned with `/spawnmob` or spawned naturally from the dungeon
+ Killing alive Skeletrons or Skeletron Primes after daybreak

This plugin also logs the above events in TShock's log.
